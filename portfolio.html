      <h1>Project 1</h1>
      For the first project, we were assigned to build a game. For the technologies that I used to build my game were: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript (jQuery) for DOM manipulation, CSS3.

      Key components of my game's algorithm:

      1. Sprite sheet: due it's nature of sprite sheets being a fixed height and width, I designed an algorithm which crops specific positions, resulting in a unique image, from a larger image. The reason behind is, because I want to make sure that image gets loaded only one time which optimizes the loading time of my image.

      2. Perlin Noise: I constructed a very basic Perlin Noise algorithm, in order to create randomness to my game. Thereby, every time when player refreshes the game, it will randomly design a new map for them.

      <h1>Project 2</h1>
      Second project, I designed a Fullstack Application, which keeps in track of money being spent by the user. Technologies used for this project:

      Frontend: JavaScript / jQuery (DOM manipulation, Dynamically Generated Content), Chart.js (Drawing Graphs) and Bootstrap.
      Backend: NodeJS, Passport (user authentication), Express and MongoDB.

      Key features for my Fullstack application's algorithm:
      1. Dynamically Generated Content: All contents were dynamically generated, without requiring the user to refresh the page.

      2. Password Encryption: All user's password being stored in the database were encrypted with Salt and Hash.

      <h1>Project 3</h1>
      Third project, it was a Collaboration team project involving with three people. Designed a Bucket List of restaurants they want to visit.

      Frontend: Javascript/jQuery (Ajax) and Material Design
      Backend: PosgreSQL, Rails, ActiveRecords

      <h1>Project 4</h1>
      Final project, I created an Inventory Management System specialized for Food Beverage Industry.

      Frontend: Material Design, FontAwesome, AngularJS (version 1.6), Moment.JS (Date Manipulation), Chart.JS, jQuery
      Backend: MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, Passport

      Key Features for MEAN Stack Application:
      1. RESTful API: All requests made to my API are being made Frontend (Angular) and communicating with Backend (Express).

      2. Social Network Components: Able to create a Comment feature were the user is able to reply and like the comments, which integrates modern social media.

      <h1>Personal Project</h1>

      Personal Project (Web Scraping):
      I am currently data mining from a MMORPG game called (Runescape). I am taking their data and making into my own API. My intentions of this project is to have a Cron Job, which will populate my database every two hours, and have it stored in my database.
