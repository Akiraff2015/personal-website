      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>My name is Akira F. Fukushima, I am a freshman graduate from high school who’s currently taking gap years in self-exploring technologies. It’s been two years, since I graduated high school and there been a lot of changes. However one thing that still kept the same was the passion in programming. Self-taught programming languages Java and Python, really made me more ambition to explore different technologies.</p>

        <h1>What is my first programming application?</h1>
        <p>Barely with any fundamentals of programming, I was able to create a Area, Volume and Unit converter with Python. The application definitely needs some refactor! However, I was quite proud, not because that I created the application. At that very moment, I knew that programming was going to be a hobby that I would practice.</p>


        <h1>How did I started programming?</h1>
        <p>It all started from high school at age 16, when my high school was offering a CS101 - Fundamentals. The course was not too popular, however I was able to convince my friends to take the course. <br />

        When, I started to take the course, I was nearly falling asleep in class because of the materials they were teaching was not interesting, such as converting decimal number to binary (vice versa) and how did computer worked. <br />

        Something, I must be honest is: I am not the best when it comes in memorising stuffs, which I nearly failed the course. Things started to change, when we got the introduction to Python; now back in 2010, Python community was not mainstream and it was a language that I never heard it before, but nevertheless I was keen into learning. <br />

        The process of installation was quite daunting, you needed to install compiler, and Interactive Development Environment (IDE), before you even started programming! I was still disappointed, that we didn’t do anything on the first day when we installed all the tools required to program. <br />

        Second day, forward. Things started to get interesting, as we learned new programming concepts, our teacher would explain on the board how the logic is being executed and then show us a 5-10 minutes long video, reinforcing the concept and providing examples. <br />

        My final project for the first semester in Computer Science was to build a simple Cashier Register, from a well known company. I decided to visit MacDonalds, and snatch up all their data and compile into a massive array! And that is when I discovered multi dimensional array, and that is when I learnt that programming will forgive you, when it comes in creativity.
